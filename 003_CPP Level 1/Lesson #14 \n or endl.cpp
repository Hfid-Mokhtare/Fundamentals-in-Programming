What is a buffer ?
 + a buffer is temporary storage we use when one component feeds data to the other.(table of contents)

when do we use \n and endl ?
  \n :  We use it if we don't want to empty the buffer intel the buffer is full 
       
        (The buffer is a small table filled with typographical sentences)


  endl : We use it if we want to empty the buffer after each print sentence



  ===>     Better is to use <\n> to print a specified number of lines and use 
           <endl> in the last line, to empty the buffer
